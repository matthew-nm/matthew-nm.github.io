Thank you for taking the time to look through my personal projects. I have always enjoyed trying new things, and so I created this website as a way to show them to the world. You can find brief descriptions of each project below, and the navigation on the left will take you through each in more detail.

If you have any questions or comments, I would love to discuss them with you. You can reach me via email by following the "Contact Me" link above.

## Machine Learning Project: Gender Recognition by Voice

After taking a machine learning course offered by [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), I decided to take on a self-directed machine learning project. I found a very interesting data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender) and went to work on understanding the data and creating multiple prediction models.

Each of the ~3000 data samples has been processed by the **R** *seewave* and *tuneR* software packages, generating 20 acoustic parameters per sample. Each sample is labeled as either *male* or *female*, and therefore we can use various prediction models in an attempt to understand the differences between the two, and accurately predict the gender of future voices.
