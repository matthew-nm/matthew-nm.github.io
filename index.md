Thank you for taking the time to look through my personal projects. I have always enjoyed trying new things, and so I created this website as a way to show them to the world. You can find brief descriptions of each project below, and the navigation on the left will take you through each in detail.

If you have any questions or comments, I would love to discuss them with you. You can reach me via email by following the "Contact Me" link above.

# Microcontroller Project:<br>Smartphone Garage Remote
I love microcontrollers and wanted to find a good excuse to play with one! This project was born from a particular annoyance I encountered on a daily basis, for which I then decided to create a solution.

I realized that a WiFi-connected microcontroller would be able to bridge the gap between my phone and a garage remote, and so this became my goal. The specific technologies I would need to accomplish this task were not known to me at the outset, but I knew that with the resources available to me and other like-minded hobbyists, finding a solution was only a matter of time and effort.  

# Machine Learning Project:<br>Gender Recognition by Voice
After taking a machine learning course offered by [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), I decided to take on a self-directed machine learning project. I found a very interesting data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender) and went to work on understanding the data and creating multiple prediction models.

Each of the ~3000 data samples has been processed by the **R** _seewave_ and _tuneR_ software packages, generating 20 acoustic parameters per sample. Each sample is labeled as either _male_ or _female_, and therefore we can use various prediction models in an attempt to understand the differences between the two, and accurately predict the gender of future voice samples.

# Cryptography Project:<br>RSA Encryption
Cyber security is becoming increasingly important in the world, as well as increasingly newsworthy. We send important data over the internet on a regular basis, and the mechanisms that keep us secure are essentially unknown to the typical user. In fact, most people do not consider internet security until they hear of a recent security breach. In order to understand the underlying system, I decided to implement my own RSA algorithm and then crack it for fun!
